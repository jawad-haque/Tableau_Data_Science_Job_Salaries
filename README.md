🌟 Tableau Visualization Project : Data Science Job Salaries 🌟

I'm thrilled to share a recent project where I dove deep into the fascinating world of Tableau to bring to life an insightful visualization focusing on employee demographics, including salaries, job locations, and experience levels.

🚀 Starting with a robust dataset from Kaggle, I embarked on a journey of data transformation, employing preprocessing techniques such as creating aliases and filtering to ensure clarity and precision in our findings.

🔍 The visual feast includes:
-> Delectable donut charts representing employment types.
-> Informative horizontal bars showcasing top 10 employee residence.
-> An interactive map pinpointing job locations across the globe.

💡 Highlights of the visualization:
-> Distinct employment types (Part-Time, Contract, Full-Time)
-> Experience levels (Entry, Mid, Expert)
-> Top 10 employee residences
-> Average salaries by experience level and job title
-> A dynamic dashboard showcasing company locations and job types

🏢 These visual narratives not only elucidate the distribution of job types and experience levels but also offer insights into company sizes (Small, Medium, Large) and their geographical spread.
